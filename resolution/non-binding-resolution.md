*A RESOLUTION OF THE [COUNTY / MUNICIPALITY]*
*IN SUPPORT OF EXPANDING CITIZEN-INITIATED BALLOT MEASURES IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND*

*WHEREAS*, representative government derives its just powers from the consent of the governed; and

*WHEREAS*, Maryland citizens currently have limited ability to place statutory or constitutional questions directly before voters through citizen-initiated ballot measures; and

*WHEREAS*, many states allow citizens, through clearly defined and orderly procedures, to propose laws or constitutional amendments for voter consideration; and

*WHEREAS*, citizen-initiated ballot measures serve as a supplemental democratic tool that can increase public engagement, accountability, and trust in government without displacing representative institutions; and

*WHEREAS*, local governments are often closest to the people and uniquely positioned to reflect community concerns regarding civic participation and governmental responsiveness; and

*WHEREAS*, expanding access to citizen-initiated ballot measures would provide Maryland voters a lawful and peaceful means to raise issues of broad public concern when traditional legislative avenues prove insufficient;

*NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED*, that the [County Council / Town Council] of [Jurisdiction] expresses its support for the consideration of statewide mechanisms allowing Maryland citizens to place statutory or constitutional questions on the ballot through a structured signature-gathering process; and

*BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED*, that this support is non-binding and does not endorse any specific ballot proposal, but affirms the principle that citizens should have a meaningful procedural avenue to propose measures for voter consideration; and

*BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED*, that a copy of this resolution be transmitted to the Maryland General Assembly, the Governor of Maryland, and the Maryland Association of Counties for their consideration.

Adopted this ___ day of ________, 20.
